# Sea-Weather-Prediction-Model
Sea Weather Prediction Model
This project uses multiple machine learning techniques—primarily Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests—to predict sea and coastal weather parameters using various oceanographic datasets. All experiments are reproducible via Jupyter notebooks, with clear data workflows and result visualizations.

Project Features
Data Science Pipeline:
Data cleaning, handling missing values, and normalization.
Exploratory analysis for each parameter (sea surface height, salinity, temperature, currents, and more).

Modeling:
Individual LSTM and Random Forest models for each oceanographic feature.
Multivariate LSTM model using merged features for holistic prediction.

Outputs & Visualizations:
Comprehensive metric reporting (loss, R², MAE/MSE).

Plots showing predictions against actual values in each notebook.
