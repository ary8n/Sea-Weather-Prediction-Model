# Sea-Weather-Prediction-Model
This project predicts key sea weather parameters based on multiple oceanographic datasets using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest deep learning models. The workflow covers both individual feature modeling (e.g., for salinity, sea surface temperature, and more) and a final model trained on a merged multivariate dataset.
